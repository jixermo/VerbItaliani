# VerbItaliani
Simple python prompt-based quiz game to test your Italian verbs conjugation skills.

# Conjugation data origin
I, the author, am a novice at speaking and writing Italian. The script compares the user-inputted conjugation to the one shown at [a certain Italian Verbs conjugator website](www.italian-verbs.com). 

I am **not** the creator of the website, nor do I personally know who is the author of the website. The script simply **scrapes** certain conjugations during the execution time (i.e. in real time). That is why the entire project file is very small.

# Dependencies
The script has been written in **Python 3**, with 2 package dependencies needed:
 - Python 3.7 or above
 - Beautiful Soup 4 ( pip install bs4 )
 - Requests ( pip install requests )
 - Internet connection
